# kalkulator
The most unnecessarily complicated calculator you'll ever use.

### Goals
- Really to just learn and fiddle with Kubernetes, Docker, gRPC, and stuff.


## Technologies
#### Docker
At the heart of it all, I'm containerizing things using Docker

#### Kubernetes
Of course. Hence the "K"

#### gRPC
Ok... eventually.

#### Opentracing
Still not exactly sure how to set up traces, but the library is there.
Getting the url for Jaeger-Query:
- URL `minikube service jaeger-query --url`
